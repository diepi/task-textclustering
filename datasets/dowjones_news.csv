Law and Immigration Order;"The Supreme Court played to a draw Thursday on President Obama's lawless immigration order, issuing a mere single sentence opinion that, ""The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court."" This means the Justices were divided 4-4 and chose not to elaborate their competing views when they couldn't set a legal precedent.

That's a disappointment. We would like to see where the individual Justices stand on the profound constitutional questions raised by the 26-state challenge to Mr. Obama's 2014 diktat legalizing millions of undocumented aliens (U.S. v. Texas). A least the split suggests that four Justices are troubled by the President's unprecedented claim of unilateral power.

'Economic Illiberalism' May Send Oil Back to $40 -- Market Talk;"9:10 ET - Oil prices could easily fall back to $40/barrel if ""economic illiberalism"" sweeps the globe, says Bud Weinstein at SMU's Maguire Energy Institute in Dallas. ""Free trade, free-flowing capital--all those things were seen as a net plus for the world economy,"" he tells WSJ. ""The worry now is that the Brexit vote leads to a series of actions that slow down global economic growth and pushes us into recession."" This isn't guaranteed to happen, Weinstein admits, but ""unless we see some evidence of moral suasion"" that could halt or reverse global leanings, then oil prices will remain pressured. Nymex August oil is down 2% at $46.65. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

Who Will Be Britain's Next Prime Minister?;"It would have been understandable if Boris Johnson had allowed himself a celebratory fist-pump when he appeared before the press in London on Friday morning. After all, the former London mayor was the de facto leader of the Out campaign, which against all odds had just won the U.K.'s referendum on the European Union.

Yet he looked shocked and ashen-faced. Not because he was now regretting his decision to campaign for Brexit, but because a short time earlier David Cameron had announced that by October he would step down as Britain's prime minister. Plenty of people thought his resignation was inevitable, given how vigorously Mr. Cameron had fought to stay in the EU. But not Boris. He was one of 84 Conservative members of Parliament who had written a letter to Mr. Cameron on the eve of the referendum saying he had a ""mandate and duty"" to stay in post whatever the result.

Sterling Vulnerable to Fresh Selling -- Brexit Market Talk;"0653 GMT Sterling starts the week on a negative note again after last week's vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union.

Spain Most Exposed to U.K., S&P Says -- Brexit Market Talk;"0642 GMT Spain is more exposed to the U.K. than other major European economies, according to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Analysts at the credit-rating firm prepared an index of which countries would be the most negatively impacted by a potential British exit, or Brexit, based on financial and economic ties. Ireland topped the list. But Spain came in well ahead of the eurozone's other major economies--Germany, France and Italy. One main reason is that Spanish lenders have among the greatest foreign retail banking presence in Britain, S&P analyst Frank Gill says. Santander generates around a quarter of its net profit there, selling mortgages and consumer loans to Britons, and Sabadell owns TSB. Outside of banking, Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica owns British mobile operator O2. Look for those shares to drop when Spain's IBEX-35 opens. (jeannette.neumann@wsj.com)

Special Report: Retirement: The Top 50 Annuities;"The $2.7 trillion annuity industry's latest golden child is the fixed-indexed annuity -- but don't be fooled by its luster. Concerns about misleading sales pitches for these and other commission-based products have prompted new regulations to protect investors. But keep your guard up: The new rules aren't fully effective until 2018, and the industry is fighting them mightily.

Fixed-indexed annuities protect principal and guarantee a minimum interest rate, about 1%. Bigger payouts can be had if the performance of the index the annuity is tied to (such as the Standard & Poor's 500) rises enough. But while fixed-indexed annuities are often billed as investments with market-like returns, the reality is that they are alternatives to certificates of deposit, bonds, or other fixed-income products, with returns whose upside potential these days is capped at 3% or 4%.

The Book of Job's Big Question;"The Book of Job is the closest thing in Hebrew to a Greek tragedy. A perfectly innocent man -- one ""who feared God and turned away from evil"" -- is visited by a series of calamities. He loses his considerable riches, as well as every one of his 10 children. And all as a result of an almost whimsical wager between Satan and the Lord. Satan contends that Job is only virtuous because he is so prosperous, and that the moment he suffers misfortune, he will begin to curse God. So far, so good -- or, in another way of looking at it, so far, so silly.

The book takes the reader on a roller coaster. None of the characters quite realizes what depths are going to be plumbed. Its poetry is so various and so subtle, its tragic mise-en-scene is so awe-ful, that there are times when, for me, it seems to anticipate the extraordinary moment in Auschwitz when a group of rabbis put God on trial, found him guilty and then, when their deliberations were finished, turned to evening prayer.

Ramadi was held by fewer than 300 ISIS fighters, but retaking it involved a massive assault by thousands of Iraqi security forces.

Now a bloody battle to retake Fallujah from ISIS is under way, and the tens of thousands of men, women and children unlucky enough to be trapped are being used as human shields. Meanwhile, those lucky enough to escape are overwhelming aid agencies. There are better ways to conduct urban combat than to flatten entire city blocks, but they won't be employed in Iraq.

JD.com's Alliance With Wal-Mart Is Credit Positive: Lucror -- Market Talk;"0241 GMT [Dow Jones] Research firm Lucror Analytics says Chinese online retailer JD.com's (JD) strategic alliance with Wal-Mart (WMT) is credit-positive. The two companies announced overnight that, as part of an agreement reached, JD.com would take ownership of the Yihaodian marketplace platform from Wal-Mart in an all-share deal. JD.com would issue shares amounting to about 5% of its total shares to Wal-Mart in a deal worth about US$1.5 billion. The two companies also plan to cooperate on the direct-to-retail part of Yihaodian's business. Lucror says the deal could help to enlarge JD.com's business offering. JD.com could also benefits from the retail expertise from Wal-Mart in warehousing, distribution, and efficiency in general. However, Lucror maintains a hold rating on JD.com bonds. ""Our credit bias is slightly negative, due to the fast evolving business model and tough competition,"" Lucror says. (carol.chan@wsj.com)

A similar thing happened Friday as the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, leaving financial markets flabbergasted. As polls closed, some betting shops were putting the odds of a vote to leave at less than 10%.

Ownership Is Key to Fixing China's SOEs;"China's state-owned enterprises remain one of the biggest challenges facing Beijing today. SOEs play an outsize role in the country's economy, even though they are a major source of corruption and inefficiency. So it was encouraging when the Communist Party's Third Plenum in late 2013 announced new reform plans.

But Beijing has been going about things the wrong way. Instead of forcing SOEs to operate as commercial entities free of political interference, Beijing is increasing state control. Recent reforms with Chinese characteristics do more to impede rather than promote the changes that are needed.

"OFF DUTY --- Ritzy Business --- Reopening its doors after a long renovation, the historic French hotel has doubled down on its perfectionist glamour; but can it compete in the crowded luxury market of tourism-challenged Paris?";"Paris's Place Vendome is a splendid plaza of identical palaces designed in 1702 to honor Louis XIV. Once homes to princes and dukes, these palaces now fly silken awnings like heraldic flags, boasting the names of today's royal houses: Dior, Cartier, Chanel. The most famous awnings, though, belong not to a grand boutique but to a hotel, the legendary Ritz Paris, which reopened two weeks ago.

In 2012, the Ritz's owner, Mohamed Al Fayed, announced the unthinkable: The hotel would shut down for a two-year renovation. Repeated delays ensued and two years turned into four, as costs rose to a reported 400 million euros (about $450 million). The opening itself seemed, if not doomed, perhaps haunted by the ghosts of the Paris communards who toppled Napoleon's statue on Place Vendome in 1871, protesting French Imperialism.

Traders are likely to be non-committal for now, due to conflicting signals seen overnight. Tuesday's modest U.S. stock market rally seemed at odds against the rise of the U.S. dollar index, which was mainly due to the euro retreating significantly. The balanced tone in the monetary policy testimony by Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen yesterday offered no fresh leads for the market. Ms. Yellen's had a slightly optimistic view on the economy, but toned down rate-rise expectations on account of the likelihood of slow productivity growth in the medium term.

World News: --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: How a Donald Trump Victory Could Happen;"A few weeks ago, after Donald Trump locked down the Republican presidential nomination, a series of polls showed him roughly even with or a bit ahead of Hillary Clinton, and Democrats went into a slight panic.

Last week, after Mrs. Clinton had locked down the Democratic nomination, a series of polls showed Mr. Trump falling well behind Mrs. Clinton, in two cases by 12 percentage points, and Republicans went into full-scale panic. Perhaps in response, Mr. Trump on Monday parted ways with his longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.

Among HK Tech Stocks, Lenovo Hit Hard by UK's EU Exit -- Brexit Market Talk;"0749 GMT [Dow Jones] Personal PC maker Lenovo (0992.HK) and ASM Pacific (0522.HK) are among the Hong Kong tech stocks worst hit by Brexit. Jefferies says Lenovo faces double hits from both demand and foreign exchange. ""In addition to likely direct negative impact from weaker market demand, Lenovo's USD-denominated cost structure and thin margins will suffer from weaker GBP/EUR"", the house says. It estimates the UK and EU accounted for around 3% and 21%, respectively, of Lenovo's PC shipments in fiscal 2016. Meanwhile, Europe accounted for 17% of the 2015 sales of ASM Pacific, a supplier of semiconductor assembly and packaging equipment. By contrast, ZTE Corp (0763.HK) and China Communications Services (0552.HK) are relatively immune to Brexit aftershocks given they are predominantly exposed to China's telecommunication sector.

Medtronic to buy Heartware for in a $1.1 billion deal;"Shares of Heartware International Inc. (HTWR) were indicated sharply higher in premarket trade Monday, after the developer of miniaturized circulatory support technologies agreed to be acquired by Medtronic PLC (MDT) in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.

The deal is expected to close during Medtronic's fiscal second quarter ending Oct. 28, 2016. Medtronic said it doesn't expect to adjust its fiscal 2017 revenue or earnings-per-share outlooks, but the deal gives the company ""increased confidence"" in its ability to achieve its revenue growth outlook. Heartware's stock traded up 67% in light premarket volume, while Medtronic's stock was still inactive. Year to date through Friday, Heartware's stock has tumbled 41%, Medtronic shares have gained 8.2% and the S&P 500 has slipped 0.3%.

"To Vote in 'Brexit' Referendum, It Helps to Be From Tuvalu --- Baffling rules embrace certain foreigners while nixing citizens; Gimli's torment";"LONDON -- If you're a Ugandan living in Gibraltar, you probably voted in Thursday's referendum that decided the fate of Britain's European Union membership. The same went for U.K. residents hailing from Tuvalu, a cluster of tiny Pacific islands some 9,000 miles from the British Isles. Irish citizens living in Scotland -- they probably voted, too.

John Rhys-Davies, an actor famed for his portrayal of warrior dwarf Gimli in ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, was born in England and raised by Welsh parents. For nearly three decades, he has lived on the Isle of Man, a small rainy island in the Irish Sea, equidistant from the English and Irish coasts, which is known mostly for a type of cat with a stumpy tail and a motorcycle race. Because technically the Isle of Man isn't part of the U.K., and because Mr. Rhys-Davies has thus been an expatriate for too long, he couldn't take part.

High-Frequency Trading Firm Gains Amid Volatility -- Market Talk;"12:53 ET - Virtu Financial Inc., one of the world's largest high-frequency market-makers, saw its share rise 1.5% to $17.94 during the first hour and 15 minutes of trading on Friday. Such firms see their biggest paydays during periods of extreme volatility. Market makers simultaneously offer to buy and sell stocks, bonds, currencies or futures with the hope of collecting the difference between those prices. They tend to only win their trades a little more than half of the time, but over the course of millions of trades they can accrue size-able profits. Virtu, founded by veteran trader Vinnie Viola and led by former lawyer Douglas Cifu, is one of the most successful high-frequency trading firms. It had net income of about $51.4 million during the first quarter.(bradley.hope@wsj.com)

Dollar; More Volatility Seen -- Market Talk";"0132 GMT [Dow Jones] The yuan benchmark was shifted 0.4% weaker against the dollar Wednesday, in line with the overnight jump of the ICE U.S. dollar index. The margin of today's adjustment is considered fairly large, and is the third time this month that such a big move was seen. Currency volatility has increased greatly this summer, especially in the arena of major currencies, and this has translated to wilder gyrations in Asian currencies as well. This looks unlikely to change in the near term, as markets fret about the Brexit vote on Thursday, and some punters start to position for next month's U.S. FOMC meeting. The U.S. Federal Reserve chief on Tuesday cast an optimistic view on the U.S. economy, but balanced it with a cautious wait-and-see approach on interest rates. The possibility of lower U.S. productivity growth and the odds of risk-off events in the near future might hold back another U.S. interest rate-rise. USD/CNY officially closed of 6.5799 on Monday.

U.K. Vote Means RBNZ Likely to Cut Twice More in 2016: ASB -- Brexit Market Talk;"0027 GMT [Dow Jones] The U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union makes it more likely the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will cut interest rates twice more this year, says ASB. It says Brexit's impact on financial markets is likely to give the U.S. Federal Reserve pause for thought over its next rate hike. ""Instead of potentially moving as early as July, the Fed may wait until much later in the year,"" ASB says. That would likely keep the NZD elevated against the USD, increasing pressure on the RBNZ to cut rates in August. ASB economists then see a second cut coming in November, taking the official cash rate to 1.75%. ""Prior to the Brexit vote, we had become less confident of the second cut. However, the global outlook is now marred by uncertainty and we expect to see declines in global commodity prices, further adding to the global deflation impulse,"" ASB says. (kate.geenty@wsj.com)

Politics & Ideas: The Shrinking of the Liberal Order;"Whatever the outcome of the ""Brexit"" vote -- the U.K.'s referendum Thursday on remaining in the European Union -- an era of Western history is ending and a new one is struggling to be born. The liberal internationalist project of the past seven decades is on the defensive, while ethno-nationalism (often illiberal) is surging.

The optimistic assumption that history's arc is linear and progressive is being challenged by the older, darker view that order is locked in a perpetual struggle with chaos, security with danger. If liberal means are no longer adequate to guarantee order and security, say the challengers, they become niceties we can no longer afford.

'Brexit' Expected to Rattle U.S. Economy, Shake Its Influence;"WASHINGTON -- Britain's exit from the European Union is expected to jolt the U.S. economy, likely rattling restive equity markets and driving up the value of the dollar.

Top finance officials say the damage from the so-called Brexit alone isn't likely to be enough to nudge the U.S. into a contraction. But as skittish investors pull out of U.K. and European markets and pour into the safety of U.S. assets, a falling pound and euro could cause the dollar to surge, further suppressing demand for American exports.

Campaigns ultimately reflect the candidate and his leadership, or lack thereof, and the shake-up will only make a difference if Mr. Trump recognizes how badly he is harming his own prospects.

Perhaps the termination of Corey Lewandowski, heretofore Mr. Trump's most loyal aide who was present at the campaign's creation, is his concession that his operation is dysfunctional. He allowed competing power centers to emerge, with Mr. Lewandowski anchoring one camp and the veteran Beltway operative Paul Manafort the other.

U.K.'s Exit Lurch Might Bring Central Banks Off Sidelines -- Brexit Market Talk;"0313 GMT [Dow Jones] As incoming results for the U.K. referendum point to an exit from the EU, traders are mulling the consequences. Rob Rennie, the head of currency strategy at Westpac said financial markets have not anticipated the current movements. Still, Rennie said the referendum is not binding, so a lot of attention will now be on how U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron interprets the ballot. At the very least, an exit from the EU would require legislative changes in a process that could last up to 2 years, he adds. If this becomes a systemic issue, markets should be watching for comments and potential action from central banks around liquidity support in coming hours, Rennie adds. The rapid moves in foreign exchange markets might prompt intervention in USD/JPY, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; Twitter @JamesGlynnWSJ)

USD/Asia Subdued as 'Brexit' Forces Shift in Fed Rate View -- Market Talk;"0619 GMT [Dow Jones] Most USD/Asia currency pairs have turned around from an early spike Monday. Some are now lower than their last closing levels, implying stronger Asian currencies versus the U.S. dollar. India's rupee and Indonesia's rupiah, both high-yielding currencies, are up marginally versus the greenback. Though the benchmark ICE U.S. dollar index is still higher compared with Friday, its typical magnetic effect on USD/Asia pairs has been dulled by traders eyeing a sliver lining for the world economy--lower global interest rates for longer. The potential for a deeper financial market fallout due to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union is triggering a shift in how the market views global central bank policy-making ahead. It seems much less likely now that the U.S. Federal Reserve, or any other central bank for that matter, will raise interest rates anytime soon. This is likely to keep high-yield Asian currencies supported. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

Arts & Entertainment: How Big Is Too Big?;"London -- Tate Modern, which opened in the former Bankside Power Station back in 2000 as a showcase for modern and contemporary art, is the Disney World of museums, an obligatory stop on the caravan of global tourism. Its new extension is the Tate's Epcot, an ""experimental prototype"" for the museum of the future.

When Tate Modern opened, it expected one million visitors a year. It soon became the world's most popular contemporary museum. Last year, more than five million people passed through its Boiler House and Turbine Hall -- twice as many as New York's Museum of Modern Art, and not far behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Yen Weakness May Reverse as USD/JPY Rally Meets Chart Barrier -- Market Talk;"0051 GMT [Dow Jones] The Japanese yen weakened 0.8% versus the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, but the daily USD/JPY chart suggests that the move could reverse soon. USD/JPY had jumped slightly past the 105.00 round-figure trading barrier overnight, but its advance was halted by the ceiling of the Bollinger downtrend channel, and the pair then retreated. That technical obstacle now looms overhead at 104.93, capping USD/JPY and deterring bullish bets. If that resistance level holds by Wednesday's closing, USD/JPY might snap back toward the 103.00 round-figure trading barrier. There wasn't a clear reason for the USD/JPY rally on Tuesday. The U.S. Federal Reserve chief's slightly upbeat view on the economy, seen in her monetary policy testimony to Congress, could have helped the dollar. But the overall tone was balanced, as Ms. Yellen highlighted the likelihood of slow productivity growth in the medium term. USD/JPY is now 104.60 from its Tuesday closing of 104.73.

Yuan Fixing Bounces, 0.4% Gain Reverses Wednesday's Weakening -- Market Talk;"0136 GMT [Dow Jones] The yuan's daily benchmark was strengthened by 0.4% against the dollar Thursday, nearly matching the magnitude by which it was weakened a day ago. The USD/CNY daily parity rate was shifted to 6.5658 from 6.5935. Today's adjustment nullified the 0.4% weakening of the yuan's fixing against the dollar Wednesday. The margin of today's adjustment is considered fairly large, and is the fourth time this month that such a big move was seen. Currency volatility has increased greatly due to Brexit fears, as well as U.S. Fed-related uncertainties, and this has translated to wilder gyrations in China's yuan, which is benchmark against a basket of other currencies. USD/CNY is now at 6.5720 from its official Wednesday closing of 6.5807, representing a 0.1% strengthening of the yuan in the domestic spot market. (ewen.chew@wsj.com)

Unless it manages to recover, the rout of risky, high-yield Asian currencies is unlikely to be over. The Malaysia ringgit suffered one of the biggest losses Friday in reaction to the ""Brexit"", but the internationally-exposed Singapore dollar also fell sharply, though its depreciation was staunched by suspected intervention by its central bank.

The point is that the relative freedom which we enjoy depends of public opinion. The law is no protection. Governments make laws, but whether they are carried out, and how the police behave, depends on the general temper in the country. If large numbers of people are interested in freedom of speech, there will be freedom of speech, even if the law forbids it; if public opinion is sluggish, inconvenient minorities will be persecuted, even if laws exist to protect them.

Notable & Quotable;"From Barry Goldwater's speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 1964:

Those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth. And let me remind you, they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies. Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. Their mistaken course stems from false notions of equality, ladies and gentlemen. Equality, rightly understood, as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences. Wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.

UK's EU Exit Could Hit Samsung Group Hardest -- Brexit Market Talk;"0838 GMT [Dow Jones] Of the major South Korean conglomerates, Samsung Group (SSN.YY) could be hit hardest should voters in the U.K. opt to leave the European Union, according to the Korea 20,000 Corporations Institute, a local research firm. Samsung has the highest exposure to Britain, followed by Hyundai Motor Group (005380.SE) and LG Group (LGG.YY). ""In the event of a Britain exit, the country will need to establish a new trade pact with Korea. Until then, Korean exports to the U.K. will face higher tariffs, incurring more costs,"" says Oh Il-sun, head of the institute. But overall, he adds any negative impact of 'Brexit' on Korea will be limited as Britain accounts for just 2% of the overseas operations of Korea's four largest business groups: Samsung, Hyundai Motor, SK and LG.

Opening of Offshore Yuan Market Aimed at Smoothing Volatility -- Market Talk;"0945 GMT [Dow Jones] China's central bank said Tuesday it's mulling letting domestic banks trade offshore yuan. This may be part of an earlier deal to get the yuan into the basket of currencies backing the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights. But this may also be about smoothing out volatility in the offshore market, Natixis analysts say. Chinese banks would have a mandate to stabilize the offshore market to avoid instability akin to what was seen in January, when the spread between CNH (yuan that is traded offshore) and onshore yuan hit over 1,400 basis points, analysts say. ""This inference is quite probable in that we believe the yuan to weaken during the next Fed rate hike or other flight-to-safety events,"" they say. The analysts also say that it should be good news for offshore hedge funds, who trade CNH as a proxy for onshore yuan, and who would like to see more liquidity in CNH and better convergence with the onshore currency.

The framework replaces a prior agreement called Safe Harbor, which had been in effect since 2000 but was struck down in October over concerns of mass surveillance by the U.S. government.

REVIEW --- Moving Targets: When Summer Camp Was No Fun;"Summer camp used to be a place people sent their children hoping that when they came back from two weeks of hell, they'd be less whiny and more appreciative of their parents. Summer camp wasn't supposed to be fun; it was a socially acceptable form of house arrest. It was a place you couldn't go crying to Mommy when bullies started working you over. It was a place where you couldn't get away from voracious mosquitoes, bad food, extremely annoying forms of communal singing and storytellers determined to share the wisdom of yore. Summer camp was supposed to be like real life, only worse.

Though the pollsters suggest the referendum's outcome is still too close to call, the market is positioned toward a vote for the U.K. to remain in the European Union. Assuming status quo remains, the dollar may experience a dip in Asia, but it could snap back before the week is done, due to the buy-rumor-sell-fact effect.

Book Excerpt: Accounting Is Failing Investors;"When Netflix's quarterly earnings announcement in April fell short of the consensus estimate of analysts, its share price surprisingly rose almost 18% on the announcement. An investor blackout? No. Investors justifiably ignored the backward-looking accounting information, reacting enthusiastically to a sharp rise in the forward-looking new-subscribers indicator: 4.9 million vs. expected 4 million. Furthermore, astute investors noticed that a major reason for the earnings shortfall was Netflix's large investment in future growth -- technology development; 9% of sales -- which accountants expense in the income statement.

Netflix isn't an aberration. The problem with reported earnings, and financial statements in general, is that they no longer reflect the realities of businesses. Instead,they follow anarcaneset of accounting rules and regulations. An alternate reality which fails to illuminate essential factors that make an enterprise rise or fall, where, for example:

Wild Ride in Store for Metals Markets, Says Broker -- Market Talk;"0502 GMT [Dow Jones] Metals markets are trading as you would expect--gold up and industrial metals down as investors digest the increasingly likely prospect of a Brexit. But how far could they run? ""For now, trying to predict the price of metals or even find a trend will be impossible if not foolhardy until overreaction is replaced by common sense and the picture of what the future will bring starts to very slowly come into focus,"" says Malcolm Freeman CEO at brokerage Kingdom Futures. He projects ""excessive volatility"" in the short term, exacerbated by uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections. ""From a trading perspective it might be argued that taking a directional view would be better executed via long options where the cost of entry and exposure is known and would remove the buyer from the perils of excessive moves."" Spot gold is up 5.5% at US$1,325.80/oz. LME copper is down 3.2% at US$4,625/ton. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; Twitter: @RhiannonHoyle)

U.S. Commerce Dept Extends Temporary Trade Sanction Relief for ZTE -- Market Talk;"2329 GMT - The U.S. government has decided to extend the temporary lifting of its trade sanctions on ZTE through Aug. 30., as the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker tries to rebuild its management and reputation after being accused of violating U.S. trade rules. The U.S. Commerce Department announced the decision on the extension in a statement posted online Monday. The U.S. slapped trade sanctions on ZTE in early March, alleging the company had violated rules restricting exports of U.S. technological goods to Iran. The move posed a threat to ZTE's business as it blocked the Chinese firm's access to U.S. components and software. But in late March, the Commerce Department agreed to temporarily lift the trade restrictions through June 30. At that time, the department said that the temporary license it was granting ZTE would be renewable if the Chinese company fully cooperated with Washington to resolve the issue.

Restaurants in Greenville's formerly neglected downtown cater to corporate managers and engineers from Germany and Japan. Trucks clog the two main interstates, carrying engine parts and finished goods to and from the region's growing number of manufacturing plants.

Absentee High-Rollers, Euro Cup Push Macau Casinos to 5-Yr Low -- Market Talk;"0231 GMT [Dow Jones] Wynn Macau (1128.HK) is down 2.7% while Sands China (1928.HK) is down 1% after Nomura put out a report to clients that Macau casino operators are earning less. Average daily revenue for Macau casinos is heading to a five-year low, according to Nomura. Moreover, the casino's profit margin on funds gambled by so-called high rollers is down--usually the casino wins 2.9% of the cash punted by the higher-roller segment, but in June the take dropped to 2.7%--a meaningful drop for a casino. The volume of visitors from China continues to fall amid the ongoing corruption probe in the mainland. Nomura also says the start of the Euro Cup from June 11, gambling on which has diverted people from casinos, has hurt average daily gaming revenue at Macau casinos, which has fallen 22% (excluding slot machines.)

Yields come down when bond prices rise. However, yields on 10-year debt of Japan, Indonesia and Singapore were up. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets following a local win for the ""leave"" camp in the key district of Sunderland in the U.K. referendum on EU membership, says Patrick Ho, senior economist & strategist in Bank of Communications' Hong Kong Branch. However, with the strength of U.S. dollar, Ho says overall Asian government bonds are unlikely to benefit given that it will mean weaker Asian currencies. In terms of government bonds, Ho says U.S. treasurys and bonds of large European countries, are more likely to see great inflows. (carol.chan@wsj.com)

The deal volume in 2015 reached $735 billion, nearly three times the total two years earlier.

Yet suspicions about Chinese motivations linger in some quarters, along with a myopic focus on the small share of deals, 8.5%, that fail. It would be wise to discard this paranoia and instead judge Chinese buyers by the success of their investments, their behavior as competitors and their conduct as foreign owners.

There could also be economic contagion in countries with close trade ties to the U.K. ""The Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium look most at risk,"" he adds. (maarten.vantartwijk@wsj.com)

Alibaba Health Falls on Weak Financial Results -- Market Talk;"0249 GMT [Dow Jones] Shares of Alibaba Health (0241.HK) buck the broader market's uptrend to fall as much as 3.9% after the health-care arm of Alibaba Group (BABA) reported disappointing financial results for the year ended March. Its full-year net loss widened to 191.6 million yuan ($29.2 million) from a net loss of CNY84.1 million in the preceding year, due to higher expenses and the absence of one-off gains. That came despite revenue rising 90.3% to CNY56.6 million on higher sales from its drug-monitoring authentication and tracking operations. The stock is now down 2.3% at HK$5.53 vs the Hang Seng Index's 0.4% rise. (joanne.chiu@wsj.com, Twitter: @joannechiuhk)

The End of Economic Forecasting;"Why have economic forecasters recently been so wrong? Just two years ago, for example, the common perception was that the big emerging markets would drive global growth. That oil prices would remain above $100 per barrel.

Yet these variances are neither a coincidence nor a temporary phenomenon. We have entered an age in which economic and financial forecasting is much harder and less reliable.

New Rule Could Improve Annuities;"Annuities have long had a bad rap, and the industry isn't exactly burnishing its reputation by fiercely fighting the Labor Department's new fiduciary rule, which is aimed at protecting investors from unscrupulous sales practices. Yet if the industry loses its battle, annuities may seem much more appealing to many investors.

The new rule holds anyone selling variable or fixed-indexed annuities within retirement plans to a fiduciary standard, which means the broker must put a client's interest ahead of his or her own. Brokers are typically paid via commission for selling an annuity, and while the new rule doesn't forbid commission-based sales practices, it does require anyone charging one to sign a contract agreeing to put clients' interests first, charge only ""reasonable compensation,"" and disclose compensation and any potential conflicts of interest.

Trump and the Ghost of Barry Goldwater;"Donald Trump has committed the Barry Goldwater mistake.

His declaration sent two messages: Goldwater wouldn't seek to reconcile with his GOP opponents in the cause of party unity. And he was every bit the uncompromising conservative his critics had said he was.

Mr. Trump, since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee after winning the Indiana primary on May 3, has sent pretty much the same message. Rather than concentrate on unifying the GOP, he has spent considerable time bashing Republicans who haven't endorsed him and even some who have. Though he would like to have party leaders on his side, Mr. Trump says he can win the White House without them.

Reduced odds of a vote for a 'Brexit' this Thursday caused a surge in the pound and the euro on Monday, as punters covered short-positions.

The 'Preferred' Path to Higher Returns;"Now that central banks have pushed short-term interest rates to zero or even to negative readings, all asset prices have risen to unusually high levels and prospective future returns appear to be unattractively low. In a world in which bonds no longer provide safe and steady returns, what is the investor seeking moderate risk and a reliable stream of income to do?

There are no easy answers. The dilemma is particularly acute for retirees. A generation ago they could invest their savings in a 10-year U.S.-government bond and be able to count on a promised interest rate of 6% to 7%. They could also sleep well at night knowing that their portfolios consisted of one of the safest assets in the world.

Brexit Warrants Caution Across Fixed-Income Portfolios -- Brexit Market Talk;"0319 GMT [Dow Jones] Brexit vote or a very close Bremain vote would warrant increased caution across the asset management firm's fixed income portfolios, says Brad Gibson, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein's Asia-Pacific fixed income team. ""We would expect the recent strength in Asian currencies to come under pressure,"" he says. ""For markets such as Singapore, which is heavily exposed to global financial markets, we would expect downward pressure on the Singapore Dollar to re-assert, especially given the recently reported weak inflation data."" Should the U.K. vote to remain, Gibson expects investors will gain more confidence in adding to Asian bond and currency markets, ""though we are not expecting significant strength in the Asian FX markets from current levels at this stage,"" he adds.

MOF's Yen Remarks Harken Back to Non-Intervention Days of 2011 -- Market Talk;"0320 GMT [Dow Jones] A sudden shift in Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso's currency rhetoric suggests that pressure from overseas may have made Tokyo wary of yen intervention. It follows strong signals from the U.S., the eurozone, and the International Monetary Fund that they want Japan to stay out of currency markets. A similar incident happened in August 2011, when Japan's then-top currency bureaucrat, Takehiko Nakao, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that yen intervention wasn't ""a daily tool"" and that officials ""don't have plans to intervene often."" That was a dramatic shift from months of aggressive verbal intervention that caused the USD/JPY to plummet. Japan was then under intense U.S. criticism for solo interventions it conducted in 2010-11. However, this doesn't mean that Tokyo will just stay out of the markets for ever.

Heard on the Street: Here Comes Another Leveraged Bet on China's Market -- Market;"0305 GMT [Dow Jones] Timing is everything in investing, a lesson one Chinese brokerage company is failing to follow.

In the first quarter, revenues were down 98% over the same period last year. And a still large proprietary trading business leaves Orient exposed to risk events. News that China is testing a connection between the Shenzhen and Hong Kong Stock markets has sent Chinese brokerage stocks up the past few days. But that doesn't change the story for long-term investors: Since a similar program to link the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets launched in late 2014, China's biggest brokerage stocks are down as much as 14%. Also perplexing, Orient already has a listing in Shanghai where its shares fetch 2.6 times book value.

How the Red Cross Killed Non-Lethal Weapons;"'We had to destroy the village to save it."" That quote from an American officer during the Vietnam War was used to great effect by the antiwar movement of the 1960s. It comes to mind after the recent battle for Ramadi in which the Iraqi army and its associated militias, backed by American air power, virtually leveled the city to liberate it from Islamic State. Ramadi was held by fewer than 300 Islamic State fighters, but retaking it involved a massive assault by thousands of Iraqi security forces.

Now a bloody battle to retake Fallujah from Islamic State is under way, and the tens of thousands of men, women and children unlucky enough to be trapped are being used as human shields. Meanwhile, those lucky enough to escape are overwhelming aid agencies. There are better ways to conduct urban combat than to flatten entire city blocks, but they won't be employed in Iraq.

In his dismissal filing, Redstone's team argues that the conditions required for him to be declared incompetent--including opinions from three doctors--haven't been met.

Yuan Fixing Down by 0.9% Vs. USD, Biggest Drop Since August -- Market Talk;"0128 GMT [Dow Jones] China's yuan was fixed at 6.6375 from Friday's 6.5776, representing a 0.9% depreciation of the currency against the U.S. dollar. The extent of the drop was the biggest since the 1.1% devaluation by the People's Bank of China in August 2015. The yuan's mid-point rate is now at its weakest since 2011. The prime reason for the sharply higher USD/CNY fixing was the 2.5% rally of the U.S. dollar index on Friday, a result of the surge in haven currencies in the aftermath of the U.K. referendum. On that fateful day, the U.S. dollar rocketed, while the pound nosedived. The Australian dollar, another key component of the Chinese currency's valuation basket, also slumped. Today's yuan fixing is expected to lead to further yuan-selling pressure in the spot market. On Friday, the yuan fell 0.6% against the U.S. dollar, as of its official closing level of 6.6148.

HSBC Raises Gold Price Forecast to $1,400/Oz -- Market Talk;"0940 GMT HSBC raised its year-end price forecast for gold to $1,400 a troy ounce from $1,300 previously on account of the U.K.'s referendum vote to leave the European Union. Cheuk Wan Fan, managing director and head of investment strategy in Asia from HSBC Private Bank, said that among the safe haven bets after the Brexit such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar, gold will likely see the most appreciation. ""Risk aversion favors gold price...gold is free from central bank intervention, giving it more upside potential,"" said Fan, noting that some central banks including the Bank of Japan have started to intervene to moderate the volatility caused by the Brexit vote last week.

World News --- THE OUTLOOK: U.S. Economy Likely to Weather 'Brexit' Storm;"Washington -- The U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union may rock the overall U.S. economy in coming months. But it isn't likely to sink it.

What to Buy After Brexit? Emerging Market Bonds, Says Citi -- Brexit Market Talk;"0856 GMT [Dow Jones] Citi's multi asset research team recommends that investors buy emerging-market assets either immediately or a few days after the U.K. referendum on the European Union, regardless of its outcome. If Britain votes to leave, policymakers should be quick to roll out stimulus, stemming weakness in the market. But the Fed's dovish stance and some stability in Chinese economic data as well as its markets are what really should help emerging markets perform, says the firm.

Japan Fin Min: Few Ordinary Citizens Care About Rising Yen -- Market Talk;"0335 GMT [Dow Jones] Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso suggested that he may not actually be as worried about the rising yen as markets think he is. At a regular news conference, Aso first reiterated that the currency's recent gain was undesirably ""rapid"" and that stability in exchange rates is ""extremely important."" But then Aso went on to question journalists' intense focus on the yen's exchange rate. ""Almost no one around me was aware"" of the USD/JPY's recent fall to near Y103, in contrast to close attention being paid to it by local TV stations, Aso said. ""Frankly speaking, that's because it doesn't directly affect people's everyday life...I haven't met or known anyone (other than importers and exporters) who say they feel their normal lives are directly affected by it.""

No Worries --- An Australian hedge fund is enjoying 20%-plus returns with an unusual local strategy -- no mining stocks.;"One early investment of the LHC Capital Australia High Conviction fund wasn't all that unusual for a Sydney-based firm: It bought a stake in a mining company that seemed poised to offer big returns. With gold prices rising in 2011, the hedge fund bought shares in Teranga Gold, which had a cheap stock price and proven reserves in Senegal. A bank had insisted that Teranga have a sizable hedge against a fall in gold prices as part of a financing package to build a refining mill. With the project nearly done and the expensive hedge about to expire, Teranga was expected to enjoy a jump in free cash flow, enabling it to pay a big dividend. But Teranga's executives abruptly changed course, redirecting the cash flows toward more -- and by LHC's reckoning, riskier -- exploration. By March 2013, with gold prices headed south, LHC sold out at a 45% loss.

Investors to Return to Watching Fed and BOJ After UK Vote -- Brexit Market Talk;"0358 GMT [Dow Jones] Expect investors in Asia to shift their focus to the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, once Thursday's referendum in the U.K. is over. Both central banks come out with policy decisions this July (on the 27th and 29th, respectively.) Fed fund futures indicate a low chance that the Fed will cut interest rates next month but chairwoman Janet Yellen could turn more hawkish after swinging in the dovish direction during her June remarks, which had followed the bank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged. She said then that ""vulnerabilities in the global economy remain"" and acknowledged that Brexit risk had been a factor in the Fed's internal discussions. As for the BOJ, which has been struggling with a stronger Japanese yen, Thursday's UK referendum, and subsequent movement in the yen will be key to its policy considerations. On Tuesday, the yen was close to setting a new 22-month high against the greenback.

Close to 40% of a total of around 4,000 of these financial platforms in China are ""problematic"" and will likely disappear in the near term, Bernstein Research says. There's still some growth, as total P2P lending balance is up 31% since the end of 2015, reaching 576 billion yuan in May, but larger platforms are getting the bulk of the business, Bernstein analyst Hou Wei says. There's long-term growth potential but little competitive risk to traditional banks, as P2P investors and borrowers are still very different customers than those of conventional banks.

Investors Likely Shift Focus Back to U.S. Fundamentals -- Brexit Market Talk;"2307 GMT [Dow Jones] Investors likely shift their focus back to the U.S. economic fundamentals, should the U.K. decide to stay in the EU, says a senior bank dealer. ""It's too early to comment before the official release of the outcome,"" says the dealer. But a possible remain vote likely will prompt investors to keep their eyes on the U.S. economy. As Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen remains cautious in raising short-term rates, the 10-year Treasury yield (recently at 1.742%) could go up to 1.8% even under the post referendum risk-on mood in what may weigh down the USD upside momentum around Y108. But if the U.S. jobs data next month helps brighten the mood, the USD (now at Y106.29) could go much higher against the Japanese currency, says the dealer. (hiroyuki.kachi@wsj.com)

The members of the Internet Association, nearly 40 of the most successful and best capitalized internet companies, support Icann's proposed transition and have repeatedly stated as much. Why would internet companies, with so much at stake in the future success of the internet, support any proposal that decreases the likelihood of that success? The only answer is that they wouldn't.

Book Excerpt: Accounting Is Failing Investors;"When Netflix's quarterly earnings announcement in April fell short of the consensus estimate of analysts, its share price surprisingly rose almost 18% on the announcement. An investor blackout? No. Investors justifiably ignored the backward-looking accounting information, reacting enthusiastically to a sharp rise in the forward-looking new-subscribers indicator: 4.9 million vs. expected 4 million. Furthermore, astute investors noticed that a major reason for the earnings shortfall was Netflix's large investment in future growth -- technology development; 9% of sales -- which accountants expense in the income statement.

Netflix isn't an aberration. The problem with reported earnings, and financial statements in general, is that they no longer reflect the realities of businesses. Instead, they follow an arcane set of accounting rules and regulations. An alternate reality which fails to illuminate essential factors that make an enterprise rise or fall, where, for example:
